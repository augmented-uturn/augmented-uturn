- i'm augmented u-turn, but i go by Anex, and closer friends call me Cake
- i'm interested in game development as well as just goofin around with code and all
- outside of computer science, i draw, am a furry, play music, and play video games (casually, speedrunning, challenge running, you name it), i also love linguistics and conlanging
- i'm currently learning GOD DANG EVERYTHING (adhd moment)
- collaboration could be quite silly, makin games, makin just anything that we feel would be interesting
- you can reach me through discord (augmented_), telegram (@augmented_u_turn), and twitte- ....x (@GiygasT)
- imagine coding on repl.it where one person tries to make a functioning program and the other person has to try to add bugs as the other codes, it'd be a pretty fun game
